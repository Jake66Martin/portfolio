## Description
This is my very first public coding portfolio. I have created it from scratch (no starter code was used)
and have styled it to my liking with the knowledge so far accumulated through the course. The only viable link under the 
My Work section is my first assignment (considering its the only work I've ever done), but will update and work upon this
page as the course (and my skills) progress. There is an about me section, my work section, as well as contact information 
(and a resume in the near future). I have also made the page responsive for any browser size on the laptop (that is
within a sensible width to actually see content), as well as making it responsive for the samsung galaxy S20 ultra.
