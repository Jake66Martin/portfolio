              <div>
                <p>Hello everybody! My name is Jacob Fournier-Martin. I am a 31 
                    year old male, born and raised right here in Ottawa, Ontario.
                    I've actually been quite interested in coding, it has been a
                    while now. I had set my mind on the coding bootcamp program 
                    provided via Carleton University in order to expand my career
                    options, as well as my future. I would say that I'm quite
                    the determined individual. My interests generally lie in 
                    philosophy and the sciences and I am very much an avid reader.
